/home/jmj/anaconda3/lib/python3.12/site-packages/setuptools/dist.py:452: SetuptoolsDeprecationWarning: Invalid dash-separated options
!!

        ********************************************************************************
        Usage of dash-separated 'script-dir' will not be supported in future
        versions. Please use the underscore name 'script_dir' instead.

        This deprecation is overdue, please update your project and remove deprecated
        calls to avoid build errors in the future.

        See https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/declarative_config.html for details.
